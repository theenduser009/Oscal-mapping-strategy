# Production mapping cleanup and minimal lineage prop — 2026-10-01

Base inspected: theenduser009/Oscal-mapping-strategy / simplify-metadata-boundary at 5590ac35c24cb691f9476b50f2f925f25bcb5bbc.

Implemented:
- runtime CSV reduced from 27 to 18 columns
- all 155 rows retained; operational settings preserved
- one canonical OSCAL_ELEMENT_PATH; INFORMATION_SYSTEM_TYPE normalized to props[]
- pre-cleanup CSV archived verbatim
- production header enforced for the configured Source One profile
- RUNTIME_TARGET_PATH and CSV RULE_ID removed from execution logic
- LINEAGE_REQUIRED compiled directly
- lineage prop simplified to name + ns + value; no class
- one lineage prop per contributing source field/host
- cells_v2 and combined notebook synchronized
- validator 17 and focused lineage tests updated
- production CSV contract test added

Unchanged intentionally: namespace urn:company:oscal:lineage:v1, 12 Y mappings,
transforms, null policies, role/reference behavior, graph containment, loader
safety, and destination schemas.

Evidence boundary:
The earlier live PREVIEW with 3,581 four-key lineage props belongs to the
superseded runtime. This repository change performs no Snowflake DML and does not
prove the new three-key payload live.

Next action:
Upload the cleaned CSV and matching seven cells, run SSP PREVIEW, then run
notebooks/validation/17_ssp_selective_lineage_contract_validation.py. No COMMIT
until the fresh PREVIEW and validator are reviewed.
