# OSCAL Mapping Strategy

This repository is the durable checkpoint for the metadata-driven Archer-to-OSCAL mapper.

## Authoritative files

- [`notebooks/NB_ARCHER_OSCAL_MAPPER_V1.py`](notebooks/NB_ARCHER_OSCAL_MAPPER_V1.py) — the complete seven-cell Snowflake/Snowpark notebook source.
- [`docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md`](docs/CURRENT_STATUS.md) — verified state, safety gate, and the single next action.
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE_CONTEXT.md) — design guardrails that must survive future edits.
- [`docs/DECISION_LOG.md`](docs/DECISION_LOG.md) — dated project decisions and GitHub checkpoints.

The earlier three-cell `ssp_props_read_only_cells.py` and its copy pages were temporary diagnostics. They have been removed to prevent them from being mistaken for the production mapper.

## Safety

The committed notebook always starts with:

```python
"EXECUTE_WRITES": False
```

Cell 6 validates the graph and target load frames before any merge. Cell 7 is the only execution cell. Do not enable writes until the read-only run has zero duplicate keys, zero null primary keys, and zero dangling edges.

## Immediate next action

A reviewed semantic correction is now committed. In the existing Snowflake
notebook session, replace Cell 4 with
[`notebooks/cells/04_parsing_transform_payload_helpers.py`](notebooks/cells/04_parsing_transform_payload_helpers.py),
then rerun Cells 4, 5, 6, and 7 in order. Keep
`EXECUTE_WRITES = False`.

After Cell 7 passes, rerun the scope validator and the updated payload-semantics
validator. The semantic-failure and crosswalk diagnostics are only needed again
if an unexpected result remains.
